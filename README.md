# Face-Mask-Classifier

The project has been built using Python with open-source libraries like opencv and Keras and Tensorflow.

## Motivation

People and business have greatly struck financially due to the lockdown and it's time to
open up. Considering the situation all we can do is take precautions, we can make it mandatory 
to wear mask when entering a property. We can prepare a software that can check weather people
following the rule, if not alert officials, as everybody else's health is at stake.
